# react-bootstrap-project
Developing personal website to learn HTML, CSS, JS and apply React and Bootstrap.

## Ideas:
1. Can I put a border around the div at the top of the page and move elsewhere?
2. Add HTML content to center and right side of page, not just left side

## Notes:
1. Get into habit of not pushing commits immediately? I forgot to mention I added Search functionality for list of anime

## Questions:
1. Is CSS padding the best way to keep the timer in the bottom right?
